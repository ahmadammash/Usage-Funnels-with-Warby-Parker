- 380 people responded to question 3.
- 361 people responded to question 4.
- 270 people responded to question 5.

There is a significant drop in number of responses when we look at question 5. This could be justified by the fact that not many people remember when their last eye exam was. Therefore, they would give up and not respond. */

/* Using Excel, we found that the last question has the lowest completion rate of around 75%. This might be because there are many people who have never done an eye exam or do not remember when their last eye exam was. The third question also has a relatively low response rate of 80%. This can be because respondents did not know what to answer and did not understand the question. 

The other questions have high response rates of at least 95%. Questions on what they are looking for, their fit, and their favorite color could be easier to answer for a general audience. */
